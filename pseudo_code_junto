//this is the pseudo code for the front-end of my junto app 
//junto is a platform for people to have timed, themed, faciliated intellectual discussions (i.e. chat boxes with a bunch of gimmicks)
//main functionality: sliding boxes and caption (by default the boxes will show discussion topic and time, when hovered, it'll show details, and users have the option to "sign up for discussion")

//html will have something like:
<div class="topicbox"></div>
<div class="boxbg"></div>
<div class="boxcaption"></div>
<div class="join"></div>

//pseudo code for the CSS:

//CSS for default topic box, when the mouse hasn't hovered on it
.topicbox{
    width: 350px;
    height: 250px;
    margin: 8px;
    float:left;
    background:#111111;
    border: solid 2px #8399AF;
}


.boxbg {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    border: 0;
}

.boxcaption{
    float: left;
    position: absolute;
    background: #000;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100%;
    opacity: .8;

.join {
    position:absolute;
    float: left;
    height: 10px;
    width: 20px;
}

 //adding the sliding animation. logic: event trigger will be "hover", when the event is triggered, .boxgrid and .boxcaption should occur. 

$('.topicbox').hover(
  function() {
    $('.topicbox').fadeOut(100); <-- or opacicty: '1'?
    this line should trigger .boxbg and .boxcaption
    this line should trigger .join 
    })

#('.join').click(
    function() {
        this function should save the user_id to the discussion topic in the model 
    })
 
//Challenge I anticipate:
//the topicbox is not an image in that it consists of information other users have submitted. so I need to wrap them up and call it topicbox
//the basic backend of this has been built with rails, but I have no experience combining these with rails, so that'd take some time figuring out.
